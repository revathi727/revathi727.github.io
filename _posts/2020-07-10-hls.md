## What is HLS and how it works!

HTTP Live Streaming is a HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming protocol developed by Apple Inc. and released in 2009. It delivers audio-video content over HTTP from server for continuous playback which is reliable and cost effective. It allows client to adapt to different bitrates of media based on current network condition in order to maintain best possible quality and uninterrupted playback.

HLS supports the following:
* Live broadcasts, VOD and Events.
* Multiple renditions and variant streams.
* Media encryption and authentication.
* Intelligent switching based on network conditions.
* Advertising while streaming.

  Filename extension - .m3u8
  Internet media type - application/vnd.apple.mpegurl or audio/mpegurl
  Standard - RFC8216{% endhighlight %}

#### FEATURES
* **Adaptability**: HLS adapts to bandwidth of the user. The original video is encoded in several distictive quality streams called variant streams.
*  **Dynamic Ad Insersion**
*  **Using Fragmented MP4**: On WWDC2016 Apple announced the inclusion of byte-range addressing for fragmented MP4 files(fMP4),allowing content to be played in HLS without multiplexing it into MPEG-2 Transport Stream.
*  **Low latency**: HLS reduces the latency building good user experience.

#### ADVANTAGES
* Faster start time.
* Little buffering.
* Good experience for both high-end and low-end network connections.
* Backward compatible.

#### APPLICATIONS
* Live broadcasts for sports, news etc.
* Media service provider and production companies.
* Real time interactive gaming sessions.
* Award functions and social media events.
and many more...
