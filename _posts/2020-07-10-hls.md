## What is HLS and how it works!

HTTP Live Streaming is a HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming protocol developed by Apple Inc. and released in 2009. It delivers audio-video content over HTTP from server for continuous playback which is reliable and cost effective. It allows client to adapt to different bitrates of media based on current network condition in order to maintain best possible quality and uninterrupted playback.

HLS supports the following:
* Live broadcasts, VOD and Events.
  {% highlight markdown %}
Types of streaming playback:
1. Video On  Demand(VOD) - Pre-recorded content. Whole media content is available.
2. Live - Broadcasting live with no backward seek.
3. Event - Broadcasting with backward seek compatible.{% endhighlight %}
* Multiple variant streams and renditions.
  {% highlight markdown %}
  * Variant streams - Different versions of same content.
  Eg: Media encoded in different bitrates, resolution.
  * Renditions - Alternate version of same content.
  Eg: Audio in different languages or video recorded from different camera angles.
  A Variant Stream can also specify a set of Renditions.{% endhighlight %}
* Media encryption and authentication.
* Intelligent switching based on network conditions.
* Advertising while streaming.

#### FEATURES
* **Adaptability**: HLS adapts to bandwidth of the user. The original video is encoded in several distictive quality streams called variant streams.
*  **Dynamic Ad Insersion**
*  **Using Fragmented MP4**: On WWDC2016 Apple announced the inclusion of byte-range addressing for fragmented MP4 files(fMP4),allowing content to be played in HLS without multiplexing it into MPEG-2 Transport Stream.
*  **Low latency**: HLS reduces the latency building good user experience.

#### ADVANTAGES
* Faster start time.
* Little buffering.
* Good experience for both high-end and low-end network connections.
* Backward compatible.

#### APPLICATIONS
* Live broadcasts for sports, news etc.
* Media service provider and production companies.
* Real time interactive gaming sessions.
* Award functions and social media events.
and many more...

## ARCHITECTURE

**Components of HTTP Live Stream:**
* Server
  * Encoder
  * Segmenter
* Distributor
* Client Software

  * An Encoder takes audio-video input, encodes it as HEVC video and AC-3 audio, and outputs a fragmented MP4 file or MPEG2 Transport Stream correspoding to each variant stream.
  * A Segmenter breaks the stream into a series of short media files or chunks(.ts or fMP4), which are placed on web server. The segmenter also creates and maintains an index file(.m3u8) containing a list of the media files. The URL of the index file is published on the web server.
  * Server (Encoder + Segmenter) is responsible for taking input and encode them digitally. It encapsulates them in the format suitable for delivery and prepares encapsulated media for disribution.
  * Distribution system is a web server or web caching system which delivers index files and media files to receiver over HTTP. Receiver requires a HTML page or App to receive HLS.
  * Client software reads the index files and requests the listed media files in order and plays them continuously for uninterrupted streams. Client requests the appropriate media content based on the network conditions and preferences of the user, downloads them and assembles them to be presented as continuous stream. 
  
## MULTIMEDIA PRESENTATION

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/hls/multimedia_presentation.png)

A Multimedia Presentation is specified by a Uniform Resource Identifier(URI) to a Playlist. A playlist is either a Master Playlist or a Media Playlist. Both are UTF-8 text files containing URIs and descriptive tags.

Master Playlist contains a list of URIs to Media Playlists and each Media Playlist represents a variant stream. Media Playlist contains a list of Media Segments, which, when played sequentially, will play the multimedia presentation.

* When the client begins streaming by using URL that identifies a stream, server delivers master playlist file through distribution network. Based on network conditions, suitable variant stream is choosen and requests for media playlist file.
* Once media playlist is downloaded, client requests for media segments in the sequence present in the media playlist.
* Once bandwidth change is detected, another media playlist based on current network condition is choosen and corresponding media segments are requested.
* Clients should switch between different Variant Streams to adapt to network conditions. Clients should choose Renditions based on user preferences.
